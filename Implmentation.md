# Implementation 


### How I started coding or how was the project made (Ideation Process)

So first I initiated the github repo now for the start I am thinking about making the core of the game which is first the player movement
Or the protagonist movement first after that we will move onto the Platform or the pulpit part


**DOOFUS (PROTAGONIST)**

SO lets make a fresh scene called mainGame in which we will add a cube and a platform or a plane object in unity or the scene for the starter
